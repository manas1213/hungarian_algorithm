# hungarian_algorithm
File hungarian_algorithm contains a PL/SQL implementation of the Hungarian/Kuhn-Munkres Algorithm
found at http://csclab.murraystate.edu/bob.pilgrim/445/munkres.html on March 16, 2015.
Instructions for use are in the file.

Additionally, this repository contains code to write two tables, hungarian_log and hungarian_base.
The former logs the computation process step-by-step.  The former holds information
thoughout the computation.  These tables should be created prior to use of the algorithm.

There is also code for two demonstration input tables, based on the examples at
1) http://www.wikihow.com/Use-the-Hungarian-Algorithm
2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm
(as shown on March 16, 2015).
